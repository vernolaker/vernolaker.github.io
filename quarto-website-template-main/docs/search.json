I am a third year medical student at CWRU. I am from Greenfield, Ohio. My research interests include alcohol use disorder, COVID-19, mental health, reproductive health, epidemiology, TriNetX, big data, and electronic health record data. I founded the Clinical Informatics Research Interest Group for Case Med students. I have a passion for helping other students learn best practices when using electronic health record data for research, especially with the TriNetX platform. The specialty I am most interested in is obstetrics & gynecology. I am currently finishing my Master of Public Health Degree, and I have a strong interest in advocacy, and I hope to integrate these areas into my career in women’s health.\nOn this website, you can find links to my published work, my CV, and possible updates on current projects. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."
