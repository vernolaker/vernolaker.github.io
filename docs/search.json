Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

I am a third year medical student at CWRU. I am from Greenfield, Ohio. My research interests include alcohol use disorder, COVID-19, mental health, reproductive health, epidemiology, TriNetX, big data, and electronic health record data. I founded the Clinical Informatics Research Interest Group for Case Med students. I have a passion for helping other students learn best practices when using electronic health record data for research, especially with the TriNetX platform. The specialty I am most interested in is obstetrics & gynecology. I am currently finishing my Master of Public Health Degree, and I have a strong interest in advocacy, and I hope to integrate these areas into my career in women’s health.\nOn this website, you can find links to my published work, my CV, and possible updates on current projects. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."
